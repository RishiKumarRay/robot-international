### Introductions

This maybe a little awkward, but Welcome, Welcome, Welcome! ü•Ç

For specific documentations, Please check the tabs over there üëà

Let's get down to the Introduction

### Why Robot International?

The Ideas is because the bot itself serves 2 different types of server. One is our Local Community (Based on Bahasa Indonesia) and One is the Writers Friends server (Based on English Language). So, the bot comes in handy for both of these servers. *phew.*

### Story behind Robot International

- The first idea is, the bot called "Clyde" as Clyde Official Discord Bot that pops up whenever there's notice on DM's or Server Chats

- After a short period of time, Time to change the bot's name. First name comes to my mind is "Carl Johnson". I think, "ah.. okay.. imma change it to CJ". The CJ name is from a discord bot project called CJ by Southclaws, (fyi: [Click here](https://github.com/Southclaws/cj)). Contains almost same commands with the original bot, but i make it more diversify.

- Then, just a couple of months.. Renamed to "Samantha". Yes! *the* Samantha, Samsung AI Assistant because she is cute :3
    - In this period of time, i'm making something new.. Adding Slash Commands! *Yass!* **THE** Slash commands.
    - It took me 3 Weeks to work on it, so yeah.. üòÅ

- Just a months ago, at the time of writing this docs (October 2021). I change the bot name to Wholesomemaker. and The idea is, This bot should make everybody happy and cheerful. so, it's "Wholesome" and "Maker". and also making people happy and cheerful means _Wholesome_ to me, so.. Why not? üòÅ

- UPDATE: Then, I rewrite everything again and changed the bot name into Robot International. Losing the Slash Commands Capabilities, *unfortunately.* (25 December 2021)

Alright, Enough about Story and whatnot.. Let's move on to the real Introduction of Robot International üòé
